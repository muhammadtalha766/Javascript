</head>
<body>
    <dl><b>Synchronous:</b></dl>
    <dd>The JavaScript engine executes our program sequentially, one line at a time from top to bottom in the exact order of the statements.</dd>
    <dd>Synchronous is a blocking architecture, so the execution of each operation depends on completing the one before it.</dd>

    <dl><B>Asynchronous:</B></dl>
    <dd>Asynchronous is a non-blocking architecture, so the execution of one task isn't dependent on another. </dd>

    <dl><b>Callbacks:</b></dl>
    <dd>A callback is function pased as an argument to another function.</dd>
    
    <dl>Callback Hell:</dl>
    <dd>Nexted callbacks stacked below one another forming a pyramid structure.</dd>
    <dd>(It is also called pyramid of Doom)</dd>
    <dd>this style of programming becomes difficult to understand and manage.</dd>
    
    <dl><b>Promises</b></dl>
    <dd>Promises is for "eventual" completion of task. It is an <b>Object</b> in Js</dd>
    <dd>It is a solution to callback hell.</dd>
    <pre> let promises = new Promises((resolve, reject) => {....})</pre>
    <dd>*resolve and reject are callbacks provided by JS</dd>

    <dl><b>Async-Await</b></dl>
    <dd>Async function always returns a promise.</dd>
    <dd>async function myFunc(){....}</dd>
    <dd>await pauses the execution of its surrounding async function until the promise is settled.</dd>
    <dd>await keyword siraf ik async function k andr hi use hoga </dd>
    
    <dl><b>IIFE:</b></dl>
    <dt>Immediately invoked function expression as soon as it is defined </dt>
    <dt>syntax: <b>(func)( );</b></dt>
